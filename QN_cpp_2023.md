### Quick Note - 2023/Mar/9 - Is C++ dead ? 


If you starting a new project today in 2023 (and beyond) and you are thinking to do that in C++,
 then that would be a really **bad decision**...!


Problem is not in C++ itself, but the amount of sheer "unawareness around how to write C++ code correctly".

There are so many different ways to do just one thing in C++. But it hit me at a much later point that, 
there is only one way to write the safest possible code - and according to **Bjarne Stroustrup**:
```Teaching institutions never bothered to train: what is that, why is that, or how is that...!. It is an institutional failure that has been teaching C++ wrong year after year.```

There are teams with dozen 10 years+ C++ exp engineers but still struggling with memory leak, segment fault, un-readable code style.

C++ is turn to 40+ years old but a standard toolset for developer still missing.

Alot of newly added databases still being written in C++, and C++ will alive
more 50 years in financing and HFT. #cpp is not dead, it is just breathing old-lungs bedridden at some nursing home.

If you good enough to write quality ( good and safe ) C++ code, then you can write any languages. Go learn Rust and Go-lang !
